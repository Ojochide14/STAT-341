Create 1000 random numbers and store them in a variable called variable 1
Calculate sd, mean and median of variable 1
Save output of sd, mean and median in R document along with your statements,name document as assignment 3.R
Upload this document on Github repo under STAT341



#Generate the numbers
variable1 <- rnorm(1000)


#calculate standard deviation
sd_variable1 <- sd(variable1)

#Calculate mean
mean_variable1 <- mean(variable1)

#Calculate median
median(variable1)

#print values
sd_variable1
